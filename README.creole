== AntiGuest ==

=== Description ===

AntiGuest prevents players from doing specific things like building and fighting, which can be used to grief.

Every prevention has its own configurable message which will be printed to the player. This message supports color codes (&0, &1, ..., &e, &f, &k)

===== How does this work? ====

AntiGuest uses permissions to determine whether a player is allowed to do a specific action.
So you should (not necessarily needed, but recommended) install a permission manager like bPermissions or GroupManager along with AntiGuest.
Usually you only want to prevent your guests from doing things like breaking and placing blocks (griefing),
so you should **//not//** give your guests' group the permission to do so.
However your accepted players should by able to do these actions.
That can be achieved by adding the permission "antiguest.preventions.*" or a action specific permission to the player or his group.

As you might see, this system allows more than just "guests can nothing, members everything".
You could for example stagger the permissions like "guests can nothing but chat; trails can chat, place and break blocks; members can everything"
and even more complex setups, it's completely up to you.

===== Watch out! Tips for common mistakes ====

* All preventions are disabled by default since version 3.0 (3.2 changes that, see the table below)
* All preventions have their own configuration file since 3.1, since 3.2 the old configurations will be converted
* The permissions are all lowercase, check that before you report AntiGuest not working

===== Filtering =====

====== How does filtering work? ======

Filtered prevention allow you to filter the action which will be prevented.

For example the command preventions which can either prevent the usage of all commands or just a specific set of commands based on a whitelist or blacklist

====== Filter configuration ======

* mode:
** none: everything will be prevented (aliases: -1, nolist, all)
** whitelist: the listed entries are **//NOT//** prevented (aliases: 0, white, positivlist)
** blacklist: only the listed entries will be prevented (aliases: 1, black, negativlist)
* list:
** the list of entries. this might be commands, item names or anything else depending on what the prevention does
** this list will be ignored if the mode is set to none

===== Punishments =====

Since version 3.3, AntiGuest allows to automaticly punish players.
These punishments are configurable per prevention.

You can specify multiple punishments per violation, you can look at the default punishment values in the configs
